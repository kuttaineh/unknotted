### Capital is a tool, not the big end.
The big end is widespread human flourishing. Capital is one of the major tools to accomplish this. Therefore using wealth to create more wealth, which is then available, is part of natural flow.

The barriers to work and hire, buy and sell have become artifically too high. Shift taxes off incomes, personal property, & trade on to **natural resource use** to witness three surprising benefits.

### Governance by few or by all?
Plays for control and possession result in inefficiency, injury, and premature death. Instead, we can focus on the quality of everyone's life equally by looking into securing the components necessary so that each is able to live a whole life in a thriving way.

### If we’re not defining the future, someone else is.
The Classical Liberals sought to remove all forms of privilege. Governments are for establishing and maintaining order. States are about conferring privilege. If you doubt the third point then consider the lobbying industry. 

From where does the power to set and grow government come? As time progresses does the locus of control remain with individuals, families, and communities or does it migrate into the state enabled legal fictions which are corporations and states? The best government is the one where decisions are made at the most local competent level possible. 

### Who maintains the work 'em 'til they’re dead order? 
How is a system of 40 hour work weeks maintained, with a normative virtue to work more without thinking of the consequences, after [the economist](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/26/no-time#:~:text=It%20was%20titled%20%E2%80%9CEconomic%20Possibilities,to%20worry%20about%20making%20money.) generations ago pointed out that by now we’d barely need to work 15 for the same standard of living?

### Selecting the appropriate perspective
There exists a materialist reductivist dialectic which history proves is useful for the purpose of dividing and conquering groups held subject to it. Disregarding the dialectic allows one to see the means to living as **natural resources**, **labor**, and **durable capital goods**. Work and purchase decisions determine our way. 

A tool for death or means to life – the path is ours to choose.

### What happens when the dialectic is applied? 
Compliance to the dialectic results in a distractive fight for a needless monopoly of power. The benefits of land and labor become a prize for corporatists and socialists alike with the result remaining the same: the treatment of otherwise free human beings as subjects to a chaining ideology.

### A shared inheritance
To avoid war, we must recognize the Earth as our shared inheritance. An efficient gov't operates in accordance with the principle that each individual shall receive their equal share of this inheritance in perpetuity. The full value of natural resources made private through extraction fee, resource lease agreement, and any actual pollution cleanup charges have to be collected. 

Taxpayers need to be able to track where their tax dollars go in order so that the same are enabled to determine the appropriate size of government. So that people may be free, trade must be free. Therefore, revenue must come via charges from that natural resource use which goes beyond any single human's use past the inheritance share.

### Priorities

Government needs to stop drawing revenue from labor and durable goods because the act cuts into the expression, production, and trade of each. In order not to incur a [dead-weight loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mEn9zxQ0Q0) in the economy, government shall have to instead seek its funds from appropriately assessed natural resource extraction fees, [pigovian](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pigoviantax.asp#:~:text=A%20Pigovian%20(Pigouvian)%20tax%20is,of%20the%20product's%20market%20price.), and location-value taxation. 

Until the services can be funded via the aforementioned revenue means: [FICA](https://personal-finance.extension.org/what-is-fica-tax-and-how-is-it-calculated/) stays but sales, capital gains, property, and income tax except for that portion of rental income which comes from location-value, and tariffs need to be abolished.

### Keys to success
How people make income and the fact that they trade is not the business of government by the people. Meanwhile, ensuring all individuals' equality of opportunity, not outcome, is arguably within a government's purview. 

What's common doesn't need to be privatized and what's private doesn't need to be socialized. The rent of natural resources is the most just source of public income.

### Benefits
By taking this direction:
 * People will stop being treated as a resource by their governments. 
 * Natural resources become more efficiently utilized. 
 * [Economies improve](https://vimeo.com/51684828): here are [28 case studies](https://www.progress.org/articles/where-a-tax-reform-has-worked) which prove it.

### Conclusion
People must be fortified to not be swayed by oppositional reductionist pathology so that focus may rest upon the source of all and also so that energy may not be diverted from the work through which folk actualize their purpose(s).
