The barriers to work and hire, buy and sell have become artifically too high. Shift taxes off incomes, personal property, & trade, on to natural resource use to witness three surprising benefits.

### Governance by few or governance by all?
Plays for control and possession result in inefficiency, injury, and premature death. Instead, we can focus on the quality of everyone's life equally by looking into securing the components necessary so that each is able to live a whole life in a thriving way.

### If we’re not defining the future someone else is.
The Classical Liberals sought to remove all forms of privilege. Governments are for establishing and maintaining order. States are about conferring privilege. If you doubt the third point then consider the lobbying industry. From where does the power to set and grow government come? As time progresses does the locus of control remain with individuals, families, and communities or does it migrate into the state enabled legal fictions which are corporations and states?

### Who maintains the work 'em 'til they’re dead order? 
How is a system of 40 hour work weeks maintained, with a normative virtue to work more without thinking of the consequences, after [the economist](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/26/no-time#:~:text=It%20was%20titled%20%E2%80%9CEconomic%20Possibilities,to%20worry%20about%20making%20money.) generations ago pointed out that by now we’d barely need to work 15 for the same standard of living?

### Selecting the appropriate perspective
There exists a materialist reductivist dialectic which history proves is useful for the purpose of dividing groups held subject to it. Disregarding the dialectic allows one to see the means to living as **natural resources**, **labor**, and **durable capital goods**. Work and purchase decisions determine our way. Tools to death, means to life – the path is ours to choose.

### Compliance to too many working hours overspends the Earth. 
The compliance of what would otherwise be free human beings, turned laborers enabling standing military via taxation, is the taking of natural resources from other nations contributing to an [annual over-expendature of the Earth](https://www.overshootday.org/about-earth-overshoot-day/). The process results in the handling of these beings, both in the conquering and the conquered nations, merely as though they were but part of the means which is natural resources.

### Priorities

Government needs to stop drawing revenue from labor and durable goods because the act cuts into the expression, production, and trade of each. In order not to incur a [dead-weight loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mEn9zxQ0Q0) in the economy, government shall have to instead seek its funds from appropriately assessed natural resource extraction fees, [pigovian](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pigoviantax.asp#:~:text=A%20Pigovian%20(Pigouvian)%20tax%20is,of%20the%20product's%20market%20price.), and location-value taxation. [FICA](https://personal-finance.extension.org/what-is-fica-tax-and-how-is-it-calculated/) stays but sales, capital gains, property, and income tax except for that portion of rental income which comes from location-value, and tariffs need to be abolished.

### Keys to success
The rent of natural resources is the most just source of public income. What's common doesn't need to be privatized and what's private doesn't need to be socialized.

How people make income and how they spend it is not the business of government by the people; how natural resources are distributed is government's business. To avoid war, we must recognize the Earth as our shared inheritance. An efficient gov't operates in accordance with the principle that each individual shall receive their equal share of this inheritance in perpetuity. The full value of natural resources made private through extraction fee, resource lease agreement, and any polution cleanup charges have to be collected. 

Taxpayers need to be able to track where their tax dollars go in order so that the same are enabled to determine the appropriate size of government. So that people may be free, trade must be free. Revenue therefore must come via charges from that natural resource use which goes beyond any human use past the inheritance share.

### Benefits
By taking this direction people will stop being treated as a resource by their governments. Natural resources become more efficiently utilized. [Economies improve](https://vimeo.com/51684828): here's [28 case studies](https://www.progress.org/articles/where-a-tax-reform-has-worked) which prove it.

### Conclusion
Focus needs to be on the actual means; and the means must not be divided into the oppositional reductionist form so that greater focus may rest upon the source of all and the work of the love of all.
