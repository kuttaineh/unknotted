_This document is addressed to those thinking about how to transition towards a just [political economy](https://www.britannica.com/topic/political-economy)._

## Capital is a tool, not the big end.
The big end is widespread human flourishing. Capital is one of the major tools to accomplish this. Therefore using wealth to create more wealth, which is then available, is part of natural flow. In other words: recognizing and preserving the [profit motive](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/profit-motive.asp) is essential.

### Dismantling barriers
The barriers to work and hire, buy and sell have become artificially too high. Shift taxes off incomes, personal property, & trade on to [**natural resource use**](https://www.progress.org/articles/the-ethics-of-land-and-liberty) to witness three surprising benefits.

### Governance by few or by all?
Plays for control and possession result in inefficiency, injury, and premature death. Instead, we can focus on the quality of everyone's life by looking into securing the components necessary so that each is able to live a whole life in a thriving way.

### How shall the social contract be defined?
Governments are for establishing and maintaining order. States are about conferring privilege. If you doubt the last statement then, consider the lobbying industry. 

In order to excise the major state enabled privilege that is [land monopoly](http://www.wealthandwant.com/themes/Land_Monopoly.html): Recognize a new inherent right to an explicit portion of nature, the value thereof, or an equivalent combination of the two categories, universally. This would not only resolve particular territorial conflicts between people but would also enable the same to always have a fallback position in any negotiation. 

For the record: the idea above is proposed out of the tradition of classical, not social, liberalism — which in reality is the historically philosophical basis to contemporary conservatism; see [Classical Liberalism, Explained](https://youtu.be/iU-8Uz_nMaQ).

## With regard to government
From where does the power to set and grow government come? As time progresses does the locus of control remain with citizens: the families and communities they represent; or, does it migrate into the state enabled legal fictions which are corporations and unelected bureaucracies? 

In accordance with the principle of [Subsidiarity](https://youtu.be/GD0moAiq22k): the best government is the one where decisions are made at the most local competent level possible.

### Time management 
How is a system of [so many working hours](https://everhour.com/blog/average-working-hours/) maintained, with a normative virtue to work more without thinking of the consequences, after [the economist](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/26/no-time#:~:text=It%20was%20titled%20%E2%80%9CEconomic%20Possibilities,to%20worry%20about%20making%20money.) generations ago pointed out that by now we’d barely need to work 15 in order to maintain a decent standard of living?

### Choosing between death and life
There exists an oppositional reductivist [dialectic](http://www.crossroad.to/articles2/05/dialectic.htm) which history proves useful for the purpose of dividing and conquering groups held subject to it. Disregarding the dialectic allows one to see, as the classic [moral philosophers](https://youtu.be/9TqJrvtt9ws) saw, the means to civilized living as the combination of **natural resources**, **labor**, and **durable capital goods**. 

Let us be in a world where work and purchasing decisions determine our way, where others aren't there to tax us for making decisions unless those decisions involve going beyond our inherent personal claim of right to a portion of nature: which is a shared inheritance amongst all living beings. 

### What happens when the dialectic is applied? 
Compliance with the dialectic results in a distractive fight for a needless monopoly of power. The benefits of land and labor become a prize for corporatists and socialists alike with the result remaining the same: the treatment of otherwise free beings as subjects to a chaining ideology.

## A shared inheritance
To avoid war: we must recognize the Earth as our shared inheritance. An efficient gov't operates in accordance with the principle that each individual shall receive their share of this inheritance in perpetuity.

### Trade, Labor, and the Least Bad Tax
So that people may be free, trade must be free—meaning free of sales tax and imposed tariffs. Likewise, people's labor must also be unencumbered by taxation. Therefore, revenue must come via charges from that natural resource use which goes beyond any single or cooperative use past the inheritance share.

### Priorities
>“People were created to be loved.
>Things were created to be used.
>The reason why the world is in chaos, 
>is because things are being loved en people are being used.”

>― John Green, [Looking for Alaska](https://engine.presearch.org/search?q=Looking+for+Alaska)

Government needs to stop drawing revenue from labor and durable goods because the act cuts into the expression, production, and trade of each. In order not to incur a [dead-weight loss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mEn9zxQ0Q0) in the economy, government shall have to instead seek its funds from appropriately assessed natural resource extraction fees, [pigovian](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/pigoviantax.asp#:~:text=A%20Pigovian%20(Pigouvian)%20tax%20is,of%20the%20product's%20market%20price.), and location-value taxation. 

Until the services can be funded via the aforementioned revenue means: [FICA](https://personal-finance.extension.org/what-is-fica-tax-and-how-is-it-calculated/) stays but sales, capital gains, property, and income tax except for that portion of rental income which comes from location-value, and tariffs need to be abolished.

### Keys to success
The [full value](http://www.wealthandwant.com/docs/Foldvary_Rent.html) of natural resources, beyond the inheritance share, made private through extraction fee, resource lease agreement, and any actual pollution cleanup charges have to be collected. Additionally, taxpayers must have an easy to use tool enabling them to track where their tax dollars go in order so that the same are enabled to determine the appropriate size of government. 

## What are the proper rolls of government and society?
Should how people make income, and the fact that they trade, be the business of any government of the people? Meanwhile, shouldn't ensuring all individuals' economic opportunity be within the realm of societies, not government? 

### Working principles
What's common doesn't need to be privatized. And what's private doesn't need to be socialized. [The rent](https://www.progress.org/articles/land-rent-as-a-tax) of natural resources, beyond the inheritance share, is the most just and economically best source of public income.

### Benefits
By taking this direction:
 * People will stop being treated as a resource by their governments. 
 * Natural resources become more efficiently utilized. 
 * [Economies improve](https://vimeo.com/51684828): here are [28 case studies](https://www.progress.org/articles/where-a-tax-reform-has-worked) which prove it.

### Conclusion
People must be fortified to not be swayed by oppositional reductionist pathology so that focus may rest upon the source of all and also so that energy may not be diverted from the work through which folk actualize their purpose(s).
